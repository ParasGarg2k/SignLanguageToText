# 🤟 Sign Language to Text Conversion

This project aims to convert Sign Language gestures into text using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It is built using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow, and features a real-time GUI using Tkinter to display detected characters, words, sentences, and word suggestions.

## 📌 Introduction

Sign Language is a vital medium of communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing communities. This system uses a camera-based approach to recognize ASL gestures and translate them into English text in real-time. It enhances accessibility and serves as an educational tool for learning ASL.
